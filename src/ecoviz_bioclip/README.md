`src/Python/`

Python modules go here.

* Every file should be .py scripts
* Files should **only** contain functions, class definitions, constants, and other components of Python modules
* Code that calls functions, runs part of the workflow, or generates output (e.g., writing a file or creating a visualization) *does not* go here.
